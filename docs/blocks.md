# Blocks

## Loop

Blocks inside the block will run forever on the actual Arduino.  It will be from top to bottom, and once it reaches the bottom block, it will go back to the top block.  The simulator on the right of the screen will run three times.

## Led

The LED block controls whether an led is on or off.  The first drop-down decides which [Arduino Pin](/lessons/what-is-an-arduino.html#what-are-pins) the led is connected to.  The second dropdown turns the LED on or off.
