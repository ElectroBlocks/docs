### Coding workspace

Coding workspace is on the left of the screen and it's where you will drag and drop blocks into.

### Virtual Circuit

The virtual circuit gives you a live preview of what your code will do.

### Steps

Steps are the step by step instructions for what your code will do in the circuit.  Each step corresponds with a block.

## Loop Block

![loop](assets/index/loop-block.png)

This block will run forever on a real Arduino but only three times through the virtual circuit. What this means is that all the blocks inside the loop block will run three times. You can change this number to whatever positive number you want.

## Question about a block?
