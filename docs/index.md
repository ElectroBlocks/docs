## Board Selector Block

![board selector](../assets/getting-started/board_selector.gif)

This block is used to decide which kind of microcontroller / Arduino you want to use.

## How to add blocks

![add blocks](../assets/getting-started/adding_blocks.gif)

As you drag blocks into the loop you create the circuit.

## Blocks outside the loop are disabled

There are few exceptions to this, like setup blocks. We'll go over them in a later tutorial. :)

## Building a circuit

![building blocks](../assets/getting-started/building_circuit.gif)

I used command or control key + c to copy and command or control key + v to paste.

## Playing Circuit

![playing code](../assets/getting-started/playing_circuit.gif)

Use the play button to see the circuit in action.

## How to see the code
