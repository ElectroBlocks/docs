## Board Selector Block

This block is always present. It allows you to switch between the different types of Arduinos.

## Loop Block

This block will run forever on a real Arduino, but will only run 3 times through the virtual circuit. What this means is that all the blocks inside the loop block will run 3 times. You can change this number to whatever positive number you want.

## Building a circuit

As you drag blocks into the loop block the circuit starts to update.

## Blocks outside the loop are disabled

There are few exceptions to this, like setup blocks. We'll go over them in a later tutorial. :)

## Playing Circuit
