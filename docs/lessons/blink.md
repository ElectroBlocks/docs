## What you will learn

How to write and basic program to control leds and how to uplaod that code to the Arduino.

## Bill of Materials

![kit](../assets/blink/kit.jpg)

- 1 x [Arduino with cable](what-is-an-arduino.html)
- 1 x [Breadboard](/addons.html#breadboard)
- 2 x [Leds](/addons.html#led)
- 2 x [Resistors](/addons.html#resistor) (100 - 400 ohms)
- 5 x led wires

## Blocks

- [Loop](/blocks.html#loop)
- [Led](/blocks.html#led)
- [Wait](/blocks.html#wait)

## Wiring Diagram

## Steps First LED

1\. Have the front of the Arduino face towards 1 of the breadboard.

2\. Connect a wire from - of the breadboard to a GND pin on the Arduino.

![step2](../assets/blink/wiring-first-led/step2.jpg)

3\. Connect a wire from (28, A) to the - of the breadboard.

![step3](../assets/blink/wiring-first-led/step3.jpg)

4\. Insert the led positive (long) end of the led into (28, E) and the short (-) end into (27, E).

5\. Connect a resistor from (28, D) to (31, D).

![step5](../assets/blink/wiring-first-led/step5.jpg)

6\. Connect a wire from (31, A) to pin 7 on the Arduino.

7\. Connect the Arduino into the computer.

## Steps Second LED

1\. Connect a wire from (40, A) to the - of the breadboard.

2\. Insert the led positive (long) end of the led into (41, E) and the short (-) end into (40, E).

![step2](../assets/blink/wiring-second-led/step2.jpg)

3\. Connect a resistor from wiring(41, D) to (43, D).

![step2](../assets/blink/wiring-second-led/step3.jpg)

4\. Connect a wire from (43, A) to pin 4 on the Arduino.

## Review

- What is an led?
- What is the first block that gets executed in the loop block?
- What does the delay block do?
- What is a breadboard?
