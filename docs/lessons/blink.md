## What you will learn

How to write and basic program to control leds and how to uplaod that code to the Arduino.

## Bill of Materials

![kit](../assets/blink/kit.jpg)

- 1 x Arduino with cable
- 1 x Breadboard
- 2 x leds
- 2 x resistors (100 - 400 ohms)
- 5 x led wires


## Addons

- [breadboard](/addons.html#breadboard)
- [Led](/addons.html#led)
- [Resistor](/addons.html#resistor)


## Blocks

- [Loop](/blocks.html#loop)
- [Led](/blocks.html#led)
- [Wait](/blocks.html#wait)



## Review

- What is an led?
- What is the first block that gets executed in the loop block?
- What does the delay block do?
- What is a breadboard?
