## Building Highfive Machine

1\. Have the front of the Arduino face towards 1 of the breadboard.

2\. Connect a wire from (27, A) to the - of the breadboard.

3\. Plug one of the wires connected to the button to hole (27, E) and the other wire connectted to the button to (30, E)

4\. Connect a wire from (30, A) to pin 7 on the Arduino.

5\. Connect a wire from (39, E) to the ground wire on the servo.  On these servos the ground wire is brown.

6\. Connect a wire from (40, E) to the power wire on the servo.  On these servos the power wire is red.

7\. Connect a wire from (42, E) to the data on the servo.  On these servos the power wire is orange.

11\. Connect a wire from - of the breadboard to a GND pin on the Arduino.

![step11](../assets/highfive/step11.jpeg)

12\. Connect a wire from + of the breadboard to a 5v pin on the Arduino.

## Review

- What is an led?
- What is the first block that gets executed in the loop block?
- What does the delay block do?
- What is a breadboard?
