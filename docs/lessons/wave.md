## What is a variable?

A variable is how the computer stores information that can change. The information that it stores is called its value. The way you get the value that a variable store is by using the get variable block and its name. A variable also has a type of data that it stores. In Electroblocks there are 4 types:

- Text
- Numbers
- Boolean (true or false)
- Color

## Steps

1\. Tape the popsicle stick to the piece of plastic that connects to the servo. They should be parallel with each other.

## Challenge

Write code so that only when the button is pressed does the wave.
