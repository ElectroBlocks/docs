ElectroBlocks is a website the allows you to write code for the Arduino by dragging and dropping blocks onto the screen. It creates a virtual circuit and allows you to step through the code, one block at a time.

## Board Selector Block

This block is always present. It allows you to switch between the different types of Arduinos.

## Loop Block

This block will run forever on a real Arduino, but will only run 3 times through the virtual circuit. What this means is that all the blocks inside the loop block will run 3 times. You can change this number to whatever positive number you want.

As you drag blocks into the loop block the circuit starts to update.
