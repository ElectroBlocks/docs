Virtual Circuit The virtual circuit gives you a live preview of what your code will do. Steps Steps are the step by step instructions for what your code will do in the circuit. Each step corresponds with a block. Loop Block This block will run forever on a real Arduino but only three times through the virtual circuit. What this means is that all the blocks inside the loop block will run three times. You can change this number to whatever positive number you want. Question about a block?

It does this by allowing wires to share electricity that is plugged into it. The green lines represent how which pins share electricity. In the middle of the board, pins connected up and down share electricity. On the side of the board, pins are connected side to side. Led Led stands for light-emitting diode. A diode is an electronic component that allows electricity to flow one way. The important thing to note is the wires connected to it. The long wire is positive, and the short wire is negative. When you pass electricity through it, it will emit light. Resistor Resistors are used to decrease the number of electrons flowing through the wire. The colored bands mark the strength of the resistor. You can use the calculator to learn more.","title":"Addons"},{"location":"addons/#addons","text":"","title":"Addons"},{"location":"addons/#breadboard","text":"The breadboard is used to prototype electronic projects without gluing the wires together with metal.

Kit Bill of Materials 1 x Arduino with cable Video What is an Arduino? An Arduino is a type of computer. The main advantage of Arduino is that they make it easy to build electronic projects. Arduino comes in many shapes and sizes. In the course, we'll mainly be using the Arduino Uno. What are pins? Pins are the pieces of metal that stick out of the Arduino. They are covered with plastic. With code, you can make a pin an input pin or an output pin. Input pins sense whether electricity is running through the pin. Output pins turn on and off electricity. Input pins are often used for sensors, while output pins are often used to control electrical components like LEDs, motors, and LCD screens. Where is the Arduino's brain? What are the RX and TX leds and pins? These pins are used to receive and transmit messages to and from the Arduino. Whenever a message is being sent from the Arduino, the TX LED lights up. Whenever a message is being received, the RX led lights up. Reset Button (reloads the program) This will restart the Arduino with the code that is already on it. Internal Led This led is built into the Arduino. It will light up when pin 13 is turned on.","title":"What is an Arduino?"},{"location":"lessons/what-is-an-arduino/#what-is-an-arduino","text":"","title":"What is an Arduino?"},{"location":"lessons/what-is-an-arduino/#objective","text":"To learn what an Arduino is and some of the parts of an Arduino?","title":"Objective"},{"location":"lessons/what-is-an-arduino/#kit","text":"","title":"Kit"},{"location":"lessons/what-is-an-arduino/#bill-of-materials","text":"1 x Arduino with cable","title":"Bill of Materials"},{"location":"lessons/what-is-an-arduino/#video","text":"","title":"Video"},{"location":"lessons/what-is-an-arduino/#what-is-an-arduino_1","text":"An Arduino is a type of computer.
