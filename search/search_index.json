Kit Bill of Materials 1 x Arduino with cable 1 x Breadboard 2 x leds 2 x resistors (100 - 200 ohms) 2 x led wires Project Components Led The led stands for light emitting diode. The important thing to note are the wires connected to it. The long wire is positive and the short wire is negative. When you pass electricity through it, it will emit light. Resistor The resistor is used to decrease the amount of electrons flowing through the wire. The strength of the resistor is marked by the colored bands. You can use the calculator to learn more. Bre adboard The breadboard is used to create / prototype electronic projects without gluing the wires together with metal. It does this by allowing wires to share electricity that are plugged into it. See the picture below. The green lines represent how which pins share electricity. In the middle of the board pins connectted up and down share electricity. On the side of the board pins are connected side to side. Code There are two main blocks of code you need to know about when programming the Arduino. The setup block and the loop block. The loop block will run over and over again. The setup block will only run once. The way it works the blocks at the top of the loop or setup block will execute first. The example above the send message block would run first then the wait block. Loop Block Notice the loop block has (runs x times) in it. That is how many times it will run on the virtual circuit. In the actual Arduino it runs forever. Steps Wiring the first led I don't follow the circuit picture exactly. You can if you want. Just remember the principles of the breadboard. 1. Connect the long end of the led into hole (25, E) and the short into (28, E). 2. Connect a jumper wire from (28, A) to the ground - line of the breadboard. 3. Connect a resistor from (25, D) to (25, B). 4. Connect a jumper wire from ground of the breadboard to ground (gnd) of the Arduino. 5. Connect a jumper wire from (25, a) to pin 7 on the Arduino. Setting up chrome 1. Go to chrome://flags in your chrome browser 2. In the search bar type in 'Experimental Web Platform features' 3. Enable the feature and click the relaunch button at the bottom of your screen. Uploading the code 1. Go to electroblocks.org 2. Drag and led block into the loop block. Set it use pin 7. 3. Upload the code the Arduino. Coding Blink Note code is execute from top to bottom meaning that the blocks at the top of the loop will run before the bottom ones run. Wiring the second led 1. Connect the long end of the led into hole (17, E) and the short into (20, E). 2. Connect a jumper wire from (20, A) to the ground - line of the breadboard. 3. Connect a resistor from (17, D) to (17, B). 4. Connect a jumper wire from (20, a) to pin 5 on the Arduino. Challenge make both leds blink at the same time. Challenge make leds in an alternate pattern Review What is an led? What is the first block that gets executed in the loop block? What does the delay block do?

Bill of Materials Arduino Uno x 1 Servo x 1 Push Button x 1 Jump Wires x 3 What is a servo A servo is a motor that allows you to control the exact rotation. You do this by telling the Arduino how many degrees to rotate it. What is a push button or switch A button or switch is a component that allows you to control whether electricity flows through it. It allows you to turn on and off the electricity. Servo Block The servo block is used to control a servo. The pin number controls which pin is connectted to the Arduino. The degrees controls what position of the servo. Button Setup Block This block is used to tell which pin to use the for push button. Under the dashes you will be able to set when the button is pressed in the virtual circuit. Create Block This is used to create your own blocks. You can put blocks inside the create block and they will run when you use the block you created. What is a variable? A variable is how the computer stores information that can change. The information that it stores is called it's value. The way you get value that a variable stores is by using the get variable block and it's name. A variable also as a type of data that it stores. In Electroblocks there are 4 types: Text Numbers Boolean (true or false) Color Wiring Steps 1. Connect one end of the jumper wire into GND of the Arduino and the other end into - of the breadboard. 2. Connect one end of the jumper wire into 5v of the Arduino and the other end into + of the breadboard. 3. Connect one end of the jumper wire into (25, A) and the other end into - of the breadboard. 4. Connect one of the wires connected to the button into (25, E). 5. Connect the other of the wire connected to the button into (27, E). 6. Connect one end of the jumper wire into (27, A) and the other end into pin 7 of the Arduino. 7. Connect one end of the jumper wire into (46, E) and the other end into data wire (orange) of the servo. 8. Connect one end of the jumper wire into (46, A) and the other end into pin 3 of the Arduino. 9. Connect one end of the jumper wire into + of the breadboard and the other end into power wire (red) of the servo. 10.
