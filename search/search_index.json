Kit Bill of Materials 1 x Arduino with cable 1 x Breadboard 2 x leds 2 x resistors (100 - 200 ohms) 2 x led wires Project Components Led The led stands for light emitting diode. The important thing to note are the wires connected to it. The long wire is positive and the short wire is negative. When you pass electricity through it, it will emit light. Resistor The resistor is used to decrease the amount of electrons flowing through the wire. The strength of the resistor is marked by the colored bands. You can use the calculator to learn more. Breadboard The breadboard is used to create / prototype electronic projects without gluing the wires together with metal. It does this by allowing wires to share electricity that are plugged into it. See the picture below. The green lines represent how which pins share electricity. In the middle of the board pins connectted up and down share electricity. On the side of the board pins are connected side to side. Code There are two main blocks of code you need to know about when programming the Arduino. The setup block and the loop block. The loop block will run over and over again. The setup block will only run once. The way it works the blocks at the top of the loop or setup block will execute first. The example above the send message block would run first then the wait block. Loop Block Notice the loop block has (runs x times) in it. That is how many times it will run on the virtual circuit. In the actual Arduino it runs forever. Steps Wiring the first led I don't follow the circuit picture exactly. You can if you want. Just remember the principles of the breadboard. 1. Connect the long end of the led into hole (25, E) and the short into (28, E). 2. Connect a jumper wire from (28, A) to the ground - line of the breadboard. 3. Connect a resistor from (25, D) to (25, B). 4. Connect a jumper wire from from ground of the breadboard to ground (gnd) of the Arduino. 5. Connect a jumper wire from (25, a) to pin 7 on the Arduino. Setting up chrome 1. Go to chrome://flags in your chrome browser 2. In the search bar type in 'Experimental Web Platform features' 3. Enable the feature and click the relaunch button at the bottom of your screen. Uploading the code 1. Go to electroblocks.org 2. Drag and led block into the loop block. Set it use pin 7. 3. Upload the code the Arduino. Coding Blink Note code is execute from top to bottom meaning that the blocks at the top of the loop will run before the bottom ones run. Wiring the second led 1. Connect the long end of the led into hole (17, E) and the short into (20, E). 2. Connect a jumper wire from (20, A) to the ground - line of the breadboard. 3. Connect a resistor from (17, D) to (17, B). 4. Connect a jumper wire from (20, a) to pin 5 on the Arduino. Challenge make both leds blink at the same time. Challenge make leds in an alternate pattern Review What is an led? What is the first block that gets executed? What does the delay block do?

Objective To learn all the parts of an Arduino and how to upload code. Kit Bill of Materials 1 x Arduino with cable What is an Arduino? The Arduino is a cheap real time computer that costs around 7 dollars. Real time means that will execute your code really fast. It can do this because there is no operating system running on the Arduino. The only thing it's doing is running your code. :) What are pins? Pins are the pieces of metal that stick out of the Arduino. They are covered with plastic. Where is the Arduino's brain? What are the RX and TX leds and pins? They pins that are used to receive and transmit messages to and from the Arduino. Whenever a message is being sent from the Arduino the TX LED lights up. Whenever a message is being received the RX led lights up. Reset Button (reloads the program) This will restart the Arduino with the code that is already on it. Internal Led This led is built into the Arduino. It will light up when pin 13 is turned on.","title":"What is an Arduino?"},{"location":"what-is-an-arduino/#what-is-an-arduino","text":"","title":"What is an Arduino?"},{"location":"what-is-an-arduino/#objective","text":"To learn all the parts of an Arduino and how to upload code.","title":"Objective"},{"location":"what-is-an-arduino/#kit","text":"","title":"Kit"},{"location":"what-is-an-arduino/#bill-of-materials","text":"1 x Arduino with cable","title":"Bill of Materials"},{"location":"what-is-an-arduino/#what-is-an-arduino_1","text":"The Arduino is a cheap real time computer that costs around 7 dollars.
