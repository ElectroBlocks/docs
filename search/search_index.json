Each step corresponds with a block. Loop Block This block will run forever on a real Arduino but only three times through the virtual circuit. What this means is that all the blocks inside the loop block will run three times. You can change this number to whatever positive number you want. Question about a block?

Arduino comes in many shapes and sizes. In the course, we'll mainly be using the Arduino Uno. What are pins? Pins are the pieces of metal that stick out of the Arduino. They are covered with plastic. With code, you can make a pin an input pin or an output pin. Input pins sense whether electricity is running through the pin. Output pins turn on and off electricity. Input pins are often used for sensors, while output pins are often used to control electrical components like LEDs, motors, and LCD screens. Where is the Arduino's brain? What are the RX and TX leds and pins? These pins are used to receive and transmit messages to and from the Arduino. Whenever a message is being sent from the Arduino, the TX LED lights up. Whenever a message is being received, the RX led lights up. Reset Button (reloads the program) This will restart the Arduino with the code that is already on it.
